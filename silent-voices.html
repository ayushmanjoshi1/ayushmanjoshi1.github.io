        <p>I realised quite early that by time </p>
        <p>i articulate my thoughts into words, </p>
        <p> i am on to another thought. </p>
        <p> And what comes out was not </p>
        <p> what i thought of exactly. </p>
        <p> So, not talking was a better option. </p>
    
    <h1>Unspoken words...</h1>
    
    <section>
        <p>There’s a weight in my chest I cannot name —</p>
        <p>emotions fluent in my heart but foreign to my tongue.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I understand myself best in silence,</p>
        <p>because when I try to speak, the words fall apart.</p>
        <p>It’s a storm without thunder, a scream stitched into quiet,</p>
        <p>and I stand stranded between knowing and understanding myself,</p>
        <p>lost not in pain, but in the raw, real, and unnamed feeling.</p>
